==============
akiraBot is a bot for Discord developed by @eduaki
-----
for use akira code you will need the token of your bot, your server id(optional)
need download any dependencies as discord.py using :

  $ git clone https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

I recommend you to use a dotenv archive to protect your bot of atacks.
